Immerse yourself in the frustrating and exhausting world of the injured athlete in this virtual reality experience, while understanding the sports psychology that underpins their experience.

A hand-tracked virtual reality experience for Meta Quest headsets built with Unity. Made as part of Virtual and extended realities MA at UWE Bristol 2023.

## About

Headset VR experience _Storying Sport Injury Experiences in VR_ (_SSI VR_) was developed to explore the potential of hand-tracked VR in translating knowledge about sports injury experiences. The primary objective was to convey stories of athlete injury experiences along with the underlying sports psychology concepts within the immersive medium of hand-tracked VR. _SSI VR_ sought to strike a balance between effectively translating sports psychology concepts and fostering a deep emotional connection between participants and the athletes' stories.

The development process spanned approximately 2-3 months, resulting in an 8-minute seated VR headset experience designed for Meta Quest devices. SSI VR was conceived and implemented by a sole creative technologist, with support from a Sports Psychology researcher and an Extended Realities (XR) experience designer. The project culminated in a public showcase at the University of the West of England (UWE) in December 2023.
